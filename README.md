# AlAzif_Lazy_Clone
This is a lazy rip off of AlAzif's host. All credits are Al's and other devs im just using their stuff

to setup

download setup.sh

on your pi or linux host run:

sudo chmod +x setup.sh&&sudo sh settup.sh

Thats it.

Be sure to backup your /var/www/html first if already running apache2 or otherwebserver because this will overwrite it.
